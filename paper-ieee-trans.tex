\begin{abstract}
From the advent of Grid technology as the new paradigm of distributed
computing to the current days of Cloud computing models, the continuous need
of new tools and services to match the scientific community requirements has been
addressed in Europe by a various number of European Commission funded software development
and e-Infrastructures creation, operation and management dedicated projects.
% the creation of software development and e-Infrastructure coordination dedicated projects. 
This work examines the evolution of the software engineering methodologies used in past and present
European Commission-funded projects to illustrate how the research on software
reliability has progressed in Europe over the last 15 years following the
foundation of the first project in 2001. In particular, we describe the team
organizational structure, %(what does it mean?)
 techniques and procedures that have guided the Quality
Assurance definitions in order to deliver quality software. We highlight the challenges
and barriers that have been faced throughout these years and how they were overcomed totally or
partially. To conclude, we discuss possible future directions in software
Quality Assurance methodologies for the upcoming projects.

\section{Introduction}

%\IEEEPARstart{W}hen e-Infrastructures in Europe were first conceived, new
%services to access distributed resources -- data, computing, instrumental --
%were initially considered. Major investments were then injected in order to
%develop distributed solutions that provided a seamless and transparent access
%to those resources, available for the researchers. One of the most known examples is Worldwide
%Large Hadron Collider Computing Grid (WLCG) global computing infrastructure, powered by the
%Particle Physics scientific community, built up to satisfy the computing needs
%of processing, storing and analysing the huge quantity of data coming from the Large Hadron
%Collider particle accelerator.


\IEEEPARstart{D}uring the last 15 years the provision of a European e-Infrastructure 
has been driven by the needs of user communities to access large scale computing and 
data analysis infrastructure to support their research needs as part of their 
pan-European research collaborations. One of the most known examples is the Worldwide 
Large Hadron Collider Computing Grid (WLCG) global computing infrastructure, powered 
by the Particle Physics scientific community, built up to satisfy the computing needs
of processing, storing and analysing the huge quantity of data coming from the Large 
Hadron Collider particle accelerator. As a consequence a number of important projects 
have been run in Europe, supported by the European Commission funding of various 
research programms (Framework Programms 5th, 6th, 7th, Horizon 2020) in order to
develop distributed solutions that provided a seamless and transparent access to those 
resources, available for the researchers.

Major developments were done throughout the years, mainly focused on providing new
functionalities, leaving secondly the adoption of software engineering methodologies.
The software delivered was then less tested, resulting in constant
rollbacks and patches applied to production systems. Thereby, the stability and
reliability of the e-Infrastructures was often compromised, affecting
negatively their exploitation by the scientific communities.

Soon it become apparent that a balance was needed between new features addition
and the reliability of the software produced. As a consequence, a substantial part of the
software lifecycle would have to be devoted to deal with the quality of software being
delivered. At this point, evolving software engineering practices were
considered and gradually adopted to define the quality procedures, teams
organization and pilot testbeds.

Analyzing the European Commission-funded software projects in the last decade
we have observed a continuous increase of the prominence and robustness of
testing and validation procedures. One of many reasons is related to the
evolution of the software engineering techniques (e.g. creation of the Agile
Manifesto \cite{agile-manifesto}, rise of DevOps practices \cite{zhu}) together
with the parallel advancements in the ICT field with virtualization and
container technologies. Another one is the emergence of automation and
event-response tools.

In this paper, we introduce a set of European Commission (EC)-funded projects
that goes from 2001 up to now, in which the authors of this summary were involved.
For each project, we describe the challenges arised, the methodologies used and
the achievements towards software reliability. The reminder of this paper is
organized as follows. Section \ref{sec:ev} details the evolution of research on
software reliability in EC-projects.  Section \ref{sec:ntsr} provides
information about new research trends in software reliability. Finally,
Section \ref{sec:con} concludes.

\subsection{DataGrid}

The DataGrid \cite{cordis:datagrid} project (Jan 2001 -- Dec 2003) 
had as main goal to develop the software to provide basic grid functionality
and associated management tools for a large scale testbed for demonstration projects in three
specific areas of science, such as Particle physics, Bioinformatics and Earth observation.
%was devoted to develop the first European infrastructure for Grid computing. 
The project brought together 21 academic and industry partners, from 15 different
countries. 
%There were 3 application areas for requirement gathering; Particle physics, Bioinformatics and Earth observation. 
The project delivered its own software distribution, named EDG (EU DataGrid), strongly 
based on Globus Middleware Services \cite{globus}. The project was organized in 12 workpages, from 
which 5 were devoted to software development coordinated by an 
Architecture Task Force, supervising the overall design and technical consistency 
of the developments.

Due to having no previous experience in such widely
collaborative projects, a big effort was spent trying to devise solutions for several
challenges \cite{datagrid}, namely the 1) communication overhead, as a
result of the large geographical separation of the parties involved in the
development tasks, 2) the evolution of the requirements coming from the user
communities (50 use cases from the three scientific area), and 3) the lack of a body 
of knowledge for academic software engineering.

Agile methodologies were being introduced at the time
through the Agile manifesto \cite{agile-manifesto}, as such the project's
development design suffered from the methods, tools, techniques and best
practices emerging from the new discipline of software engineering
\cite{agile}. Nonetheless, the project focused on the experiences and procedures
used by different open source software projects, such as Linux and Apache, trying to reach a
higher maturity level \cite{cmm}.

\subsection{Enabling Grids for E--sciencE}

The three phases of Enabling Grids for E--sciencE (EGEE, Apr 2004 -- Apr 2010)
\cite{cordis:egee, cordis:egee2, cordis:egee3} projects brought together
scientists and engineers from more than 240 institutions in 45 countries to
provide a seamless Grid infrastructure for e--Science. EGEE--II and EGEE--III
featured the internationalization of the project, embracing worldwide research
institutions and user communities. The software to sustain the increasing
requirements from the diverse scientific communities would need to develop a
rich set of new services while maintaining a sustainable infrastructure for
Grid computing, eventually used by more than 15 thousand researchers and deployed in
over 250 institutions.

The {\sl gLite} middleware \cite{glite} was the ultimate
official software distribution of EGEE as of 2006, after two years of prototyping and
re--engineering efforts to converge with LHC Computing Grid (LCG--2), Virtual
Data Toolkit (VDT) and Condor \cite{condor} software distributions. The
development team was comprised of more that 80 people from 12 academic and
industrial partners, that issued more than 10 thousand bug fixes, 1.7 thousand patches and
defined over 300 development tasks tracked by the use of bug/task management tools.

The source code was available at a private, centralized version control system.
The code was passed through a manual certification procedure at the time of the release. 
This procedure tried to improve the reliability of the software components by applying an
acceptance criteria plan at each stage of the software release process 
\cite{egee:acceptance-criteria} i.e. integration, certification, pre--production and 
production. Starting with EGEE--II, the project adopted automation in the software
lifecycle process by leveraging the automatic build system for Grid middleware: ETICS 
\cite{etics} solution.

\subsection{E--Infrastructure for Testing, Integration and Configuration of Software}

The E--Infrastructure for Testing, Integration and Configuration of Software
\cite{cordis:etics, cordis:etics2} (ETICS, Jan 2006 -- Feb 2010) project aimed
at addressing the challenges in producing quality software in distributed,
collaborative projects such as EGEE and its gLite middleware. The framework
integrated different technologies and tools in order to provide automated configuration,
build and testing capabilities, as well as auto-generated documentation and
software metrics gathering such as Source Lines Of Code (SLOC), complexity and
number of defects/bugs \cite{etics}. The ETICS framework was the first automated
service for delivering quality software products in distributed environments like
the Grids.

\subsection{European Middleware Initiative}

The European Middleware Initiative (EMI, May 2010 -- Apr 2013)
\cite{cordis:emi} project joined the 4 major Grid middleware providers in
Europe at the time -- {\sl gLite}, {\sl UNICORE}, {\sl ARC} and {\sl dCache} --
with the goal to maintain and evolve the middleware focusing on extending their
interoperability and improving the reliability of the services. The
ISO/IEC 9126 \cite{iso-9126} standard was used in order to identify a set of
characteristics that needed to be present in the EMI software products and
processes to be able to meet the EMI quality requirements
\cite{emi-quality-model}.

For each software characteristic, a set of associated
metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were identified and defined in
detail in the EMI Metrics Specification \cite{emi-metrics}. The project
leveraged the {\sl ETICS} service for the development, continuous integration and release management,
as well as for metric tracking, making queries on the collected data to display
them through the chart generation framework.

\subsection{EGI--Integrated Sustainable Pan--European Infrastructure}

The EGI--InSPIRE (Integrated Sustainable Pan--European Infrastructure for
Researchers in Europe, May 2010 -- May 2014) project \cite{cordis:egi-inspire}
arose as the continuation of the EGEE--III project, with the mission of establishing and
maintaining a sustainable European Grid Infrastructure.


EGI--InSPIRE not only ensured the coordination of the operation of a secure, reliable 
European-wide production grid infrastructure federated from national grid initiatives 
that is integrated and interoperates with other grids worldwide but also foreseed the 
maintenance and development of operational tools, like the Operations Portal \cite{egi-ops}, 
the EGI Helpdesk \cite{ggus} or Grid configuration repository (GOCDB) \cite{gocdb} and the 
coordination of the external provision of software required by EGI to 
form the production infrastructure. For the later it maintained a production--ready 
Grid computing middleware distribution called {\sl UMD} (Unified Middleware Distribution) and 
defined general and component specific quality criteria to be applied to software 
components made available through this repository.
The role of {\sl UMD} was to enforce the fulfilment of this set of quality
criteria \cite{egi-qc} in the software being delivered (i.e.,
{\sl EMI} and {\sl Globus}) \cite{mario}. {\sl UMD} is still being used and
deployed in the European scientific e--Infrastructures under a follow--up
project, the EGI--Engage (Engaging the EGI Community towards an Open Science
Commons) \cite{cordis:egi-engage}. This distribution is currently complemented
by a Cloud--specific one called {\sl CMD} (Cloud Middleware Distribution).

\subsection{INtegrating Distributed data Infrastructures for Global
explOitation}

The INDIGO-DataCloud (INtegrating Distributed data Infrastructures for Global
explOitation, Apr 2015 -- Sep 2017) \cite{cordis:indigo} is the last
project of software development considered in this review. At the time of writing
the project is succeeding in providing solutions to address the existing gaps in
cloud Platform--as--a--Service (PaaS) and Software--as--a--Service (SaaS) levels,
helping developers, e--Infrastructures and scientific communities to exploit
Cloud computing benefits.

\section{New trends in software reliability}
\label{sec:ntsr}

The INDIGO--Datacloud project reflects the progress made in software
quality and reliability aspects throughout the past scientific European
experiences. Nevertheless (I would remove this), the project’s Quality Assurance procedures are also
highly influenced by the insights of current big worldwide collaborations of
software development. These collaborations have continuously inspired the use of new
technologies and procedures to increase the robustness and quality of the
software being delivered. In this scenario, the implementation of the DevOps culture 
is one of the major outcomes, as this paradigm has been progressively adopted by the
project.

\subsection{DevOps practices}
\label{sec:devops}

The DevOps methods emphasize on exercising Quality Assurance techniques to
avoid infrastructure disruption whenever new developments are deployed into
production. The INDIGO--DataCloud project promoted the application of a 
Continuous Integration (CI) scenario to enforce the Quality Assurance requirements 
for any piece of software being produced within the project. Such environment 
requires an automation ready--to--go infrastructure where the different services involved
(source code management platform, automation server) interact with each other
to trigger the quality check execution and return back the exit codes, together
with their outputs. To accomplish this, the project leveraged on tightly
integrated open source tools such as GitHub \cite{github}, as source code repository
and Jenkins \cite{jenkins}, as continuous integration system, as well as relying on
Docker container provisioning to speed up the source code validation. This CI
approach is guiding the project’s software development phase throughout the
first and second major releases.

As DevOps suggests, frequent releases positively affect the reliability of the
software. The software updates of INDIGO--DataCloud products taking place since
the second major release are passing through a Continuous Delivery (CD)
pipeline that adds the packaging of the software right after the successful execution of
the quality checks (as part of the CI). 
The steps defined within the CD pipeline differ whether the software is to be distributed via Docker
images (see Figure \ref{fig:fig_CD}) or via operating system’s packages, rpms or debs. In the latter case an extra
validation step is added, consisting in the product’s deployment using a
Configuration Management (CM) solution. The installation uses the packages
built in the previous step and uploaded to a testing
repository. In the case of Docker images, the CM is used to build the image
itself, installing and configuring the product before uploading it to the
DockerHub repository \cite{indigo-dockerhub}. 


\begin{figure*}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/devops.png}
\caption{Continuous Delivery workflow for Docker images.}
\label{fig:fig_CD}
\end{figure*}


\subsection{Software Quality Procedures}

The software quality policies \cite{indigo-d31} cover: 1) the identification
and description of the \emph{quality requirements} that the software need to
comply with, and 2) the \emph{quality metrics}.

The requirements are checked at early stages in the software development
process, integrated in the Jenkins CI service \cite{indigo-jenkins}, so that any
bug or design issue is likely to be detected and corrected promptly. The source
code is publicly available in GitHub repositories under the project organization called
{\sl indigo-dc} \cite{indigo-github} to increase the visibility of the products
catalogue, promoting the external contributions and software adoption. Furthermore,
the source code is checked for compliance with community de--facto style standards,
selected for each one of the variety of programming languages being used as seen in
Figure \ref{fig:fig_codestyle}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/codestyle.png}
\caption{Code style standards followed by INDIGO--DataCloud's software products.}
\label{fig:fig_codestyle}
\end{figure}

Unit testing coverage, another project quality metric, has increased between the first ({\sl INDIGO-1}) and the
second ({\sl INDIGO-2}) INDIGO--DataCloud releases, reaching an average value of
66.69\% on the {\sl INDIGO-2} release, very close to the recommended 70\% threshold
defined by the project’s SQA base criteria \cite{indigo-d31}. A comparison graph
between the code coverage for the products involved both in {\sl INDIGO-1} and
{\sl INDIGO-2} releases is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig_unittest}. As it can be seen,
a very small set of products with low coverage values highly impacted the overall
result, although a significant part of these products are upstream contributions
or products with codebases not fully under the control of the project. Nevertheless,
60\% of the products were over this threshold while 80\% of them had values above
the 50\% coverage.

The documentation of the products is treated as source code, using a markup
language, automatically rendered and uploaded to online repositories
\cite{indigo-gitbook}. Changes in both documentation and source code are
human--reviewed as the last step before merging them into the production
repository or official documentation.

Last but not least, as described in section \ref{sec:devops}, in order
to facilitate the usage of the INDIGO--DataCloud services, they can be deployed
automatically using either Ansible \cite{indigo-ansible} or Puppet
\cite{indigo-puppet} open--source configuration tools. The adoption of such Configuration Management
tools not only eases the consumption of the products developed by external users or
infrastructures, but also tackles the correct installation and configuration of the
services and applications. A representative example is the \textit{50 roles} being 
developed within the project and currently hosted in the Ansible Galaxy portal for 
the project \footnote{https://galaxy.ansible.com/indigo-dc/}.

\begin{figure*}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/unittest.png}
\caption{Unit testing coverage for the two major INDIGO--DataCloud releases.}
\label{fig:fig_unittest}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:fig_confman} shows the number of products that offer an automated means
for deployment. It shows an increase after the {\sl INDIGO-1} release especially
in the previous weeks of each of the two major releases.

The evaluation of the software quality is performed by measuring the values of
the metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) defined based upon the
ISO/IEC 9126 standard. These metrics cover the development, release and
maintenance phases of the software lifecycle. Development and release metrics
are obtained automatically from several sources, such as GitHub and Jenkins CI
service, and graphically displayed as GitHub pages using GrimoireLab framework
\cite{grimoirelab}. Maintenance and user support metrics are collected from the
different sources of data such as GGUS \cite{ggus} and Github Issues.

set of deployed INDIGO-DataCloud components or services.}
\label{fig:fig_pilotpreview}
	\end{subfigure}
\end{figure*}


\subsection{DevOps adoption from user communities}

The experience gathered throughout the project with regard to the adoption of
different DevOps practices is not only useful and suitable for the software related
to the core services in the INDIGO-DataCloud solution, but also applicable to the
development and distribution of the applications coming from the user communities.

Two applications from "Definition of Support to Research Communities" workpackage, 
DisVis \cite{disvis} and PowerFit \cite{powerfit}, were
integrated into a similar CI/CD pipeline described in section \ref{sec:devops}.
Figure \ref{fig:fig_disvis} shows the pipeline for the Disvis application.

User application developers were provided with both a means to validate the
source code before merging and the creation of a new versioned Docker image,
automatically available in the INDIGO-DataCloud’s application repository.

The novelty introduced in the pipeline above is the validation of the application.
Once the application is packaged as a Docker image, and subsequently uploaded
to the Dockerhub repository, it is instantiated in a new container to be validated.
The application is then executed and the results compared with a set of reference outputs.
Thus this pipeline implementation goes a step forward by testing the application
execution for the latest available Docker image in the catalogue.

\subsection{Integration, preview and early adoption}

Two pilot infrastructures are at the disposal of developers and scientific
communities involved in the project. The aim of these testbeds is to test the
level of integration between the components involved in the INDIGO--DataCloud
solutions and use cases validation, by deploying and executing the applications
with the last stable version of the software in environments as similar as 
possible to production ones. A map of the Pilot Preview
infrastructure is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:fig_pilotpreview}, it shows the
resources providers and the components or services they deployed and supported.


The released software is tested in production environments through the
Staged--Rollout process, before inclusion in the EGI's CloudManagement Distribution (CMD). 
Selected resource providers are requested to install
the most updated stable versions of the software, and to give access to them to their users. The
Staged--Rollout process is key to detect and mitigate issues that could only
appear in production environments.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:con}

It is a fact that the European software produced for scientific purposes is
evolving to a more sustainable model where the quality and reliability of
software is being prioritized. Recent software engineering insights, such as
DevOps approaches, are gradually being applied as the open--source collaborative tools
evolve, allowing tighter integrations. The Software Quality
Assurance procedures have been integrated in the development stage, in order to
detect and correct issues early in the software lifecycle. Automation and
metrics analysis are at the base of prompt issue solving. However, post--release
validation, through the preview testbeds or the Staged--rollout process, are
also needed to strengthen the software reliability for scientific usage.
